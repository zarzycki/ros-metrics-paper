@article{jeong2018rain,
	abstract = {This study evaluates projected changes to rain-on-snow (ROS) characteristics (i.e., frequency, rainfall amount, and runoff) for the future 2041--2070 period with respect to the current 1976--2005 period over North America using six simulations, based on two Canadian RCMs, driven by two driving GCMs for RCP4.5 and 8.5 emission pathways. Prior to assessing projected changes, the two RCMs are evaluated by comparing ERA-Interim driven RCM simulations with available observations, and results indicate that both models reproduce reasonably well the observed spatial patterns of ROS event frequency and other related features. Analysis of current and future simulations suggest general increases in ROS characteristics during the November--March period for most regions of Canada and for northwestern US for the future period, due to an increase in the rainfall frequency with warmer air temperatures in future. Future ROS runoff is often projected to increase more than future ROS rainfall amounts, particularly for northeastern North America, during snowmelt months, as ROS events usually accelerate snowmelt. The simulations show that ROS event is a primary flood generating mechanism over most of Canada and north-western and -central US for the January--May period for the current period and this is projected to continue in the future period. More focused analysis over selected basins shows decreases in future spring runoff due to decreases in both snow cover and ROS runoff. The above results highlight the need to take into consideration ROS events in water resources management adaptation strategies for future climate.},

@article{pradhanang2013rain,
	abstract = {Abstract Rain-on-snow (ROS) runoff events are important hydro-meteorological phenomenon due to their association with flooding. The severity of ROS runoff events depends on the magnitude of the precipitation, air temperature elevation, snow water equivalent (SWE), and areal extent of the antecedent snowpack. Examining the consequences of these factors acting together creates challenges for both flood prediction and flood risk assessments. This study provides information on the spatial patterns, and seasonality of ROS events in New York. We examine the spatial and temporal variability of ROS events for water years 2004 to 2012 from SNOw Data Assimilation System products for New York. Liquid and solid precipitation, snow depth, snowmelt, SWE, maximum and minimum temperature, hydrograph characteristics, and annual peak flow are examined. There is significant positive correlation of ROS days and ROS triggered events with elevation and negative correlation of these events with increasing air temperature. Our study shows that ROS events are dominant in high elevation areas of Adirondack and Catskill regions, and their distribution varies with month. Cumulative runoffs from ROS events are generally greater than the rain-only runoff events. The majorities of annual peak flows in the study watersheds are the results of ROS events and lasted from a few days to many weeks. Copyright {\copyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{suriano2021declining,
	abstract = {Abstract At a continental scale, trends in aggregate ablation frequency inform changes in snow cover extent, however the variability and trends in the frequency and magnitude of snow ablation events at regional scales are less well understood. Determining such variability is critical in describing regional hydroclimate, where snow ablation can influence streamflow, soil moisture and groundwater supplies. This study uses a gridded dataset of United States and Canadian snow ablation events derived from 1960 to 2009 surface observations to examine spatial and temporal variations of snow ablation frequency. Here, we show a relatively narrow band of peak ablation frequency seasonally advances and recedes over North America, forced by variations in snow depth and meteorological conditions suitable for ablation. Particularly in more moist regions away from the continent's interior, hydrologically relevant ablation events of at least 10.0 cm occur on an approximately yearly basis. Collectively, ablation events became significantly less frequent with time, where events specifically in the Appalachians and in Great Lakes regions declined by as much as 75\% over the 50-year period. Decreases in ablation frequency across the study region are primarily driven by significant decreases in snow cover, inhibiting the potential for ablation to occur due to a lack of sufficiently deep snowpacks. These results point to important snow cover related changes in the hydrologic cycle in a warming climate and highlight specific areas of interest where more localized analysis of ablation trends and forcing mechanisms would be appropriate.},

@article{sun2019impact,
	abstract = {Abstract Nudging is a simulation technique widely used in sensitivity studies and in the evaluation of atmosphere models. Care is needed in the experimental setup in order to achieve the desired constraint on the simulated atmospheric processes without introducing undue intervention. In this study, sensitivity experiments are conducted with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Atmosphere Model Version 1 (EAMv1) to identify setups that can give results representative of the model's long-term climate and meanwhile reasonably capture characteristics of the observed meteorological conditions to facilitate the comparison of model results with measurements. We show that when the prescribed meteorological conditions are temporally interpolated to the model time to constrain EAM's horizontal winds at each time step, a nudged simulation can reproduce the characteristic evolution of the observed weather events (especially in middle and high latitudes) as well as the model's long-term climatology, although nudging also leads to nonnegligible regional changes in wind-driven aerosol emissions, low-level clouds in the stratocumulus regime, and cloud and precipitation near the maritime continent. Compared to its predecessor model used in an earlier study, EAMv1 is less sensitive to temperature nudging, although significant impacts on the cloud radiative effects still exist. EAMv1 remains very sensitive to humidity nudging. Constraining humidity substantially improves the correlation between the simulated and observed tropical precipitation but also leads to large changes in the long-term statistics of the simulated precipitation, clouds, and aerosol lifecycle.},
